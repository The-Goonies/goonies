## Root: .env  ##

We use dotenv npm module and a '.env' file to store local environmental variables. These appear as process.env[variable name] throughout the code and include:
1) DB_URL: URL to postgres database set up on on ElephantSQL
2) HEROKU_AUTH: token from Heroku that allows Travis CI (see .travis.yml folder to run tests on github commits

To ensure these variables are available in the deployed environment, all necessary environmental variables are passed along to Heroku by entering these variables via the Heroku dashboard online.
